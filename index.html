		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<p>Hey there,</p>
		<p>
			My name is Travis Vesbach.
		</p>
		<p>
			After graduating from university in 2014, I moved to Japan for a few years to teach English.  During my time there, I studied Japanese, learned more about the world outside of the U.S., and learnted more about myself.  Though I loved my time there, I decided to return in order to pursue a career in programming.
		</p>  
		<p>
			Since returning in May of 2017, I have been fully focused on studying by using The Odin Project as my guide.  One of my most rewarding projects was making a Facebook clone using Ruby on Rails.  More recently, I have been developing my JavaScript skills.
		</p>
		<p>
			I believe that my hard-working and friendly personality, combined with my quick learning skills and nature to relentlessly face problems head on can allow me to become an asset to any development team.  I am always interested in learning new languages and skills to help me become a better programmer. 
		</p>

		Please take a look at some of my projects described on the <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a>.
