		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		<p>Hey there,</p>
		<p>
			My name is Travis Vesbach.
		</p>
		<p>
			After graduating from university in 2014, I moved to Japan for a few years to teach English.  During my time there, I studied Japanese, learnt more about the world outside of the U.S., and learnt more about myself.
		</p>  
		<p>
			Though I loved my time in Japan, and look back on it with great fondness, I made the decision to return to the U.S. in order to self study and dive into the world of software engineering and web development.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since returning in May, I have been teaching myself programming by using The Odin Project as a guide.  Now after fully focusing on studying for several months, I am ready to get my career rolling.  With my quick learning skills and friendly personality, I'm confident that I can become an asset to any team.
		</p>


		Please take a look at some of my projects described on the <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio page</a>.
